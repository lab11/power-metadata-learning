# power-metadata-learning
Trying to learn device class based on a power trace. Josh and Neal's ML class project.

### LSTM config
Replace dataset and logging directory with directory to dataset and logs, respectively.

Run tensorboard with:
```
tensorboard --logdir = <log_dir>
```

Currently runs on [UCR
timeseries](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/) data. Adapted from
https://github.com/RobRomijnders/LSTM_tsc.
